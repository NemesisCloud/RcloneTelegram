# RcloneTelegram
TypeScript class named `TelegramBackend` that provides an implementation of the rclone backend for Telegram. To make it functional, you need to do the following:

1. Install the required packages:

   ```

   npm install telegraf rclone node-fetch crypto

   ```

2. Create a Telegram bot by following the instructions in the Telegram documentation.

3. Replace `BOT_TOKEN` with your Telegram bot token in the following line:

   ```

   const telegram = new Telegraf('BOT_TOKEN');

   ```

4. Replace `this.config.telegramChatId` with the chat ID of the Telegram chat where you want to upload the files. You can get the chat ID by sending a message to your bot and then accessing the `chat` object in the message object.

5. Save the code in a file named `telegram-backend.ts` and compile it to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler:

   ```

   tsc telegram-backend.ts

   ```

6. Use the `rclone` command-line tool to configure the Telegram backend by running the following command:

   ```

   rclone config

   ```

   Follow the instructions to configure the backend, and use `TelegramBackend` as the backend type. You will need to provide the following configuration options:

   - `telegram_chat_id`: The chat ID of the Telegram chat where you want to upload the files.

   - `type`: `telegram`

   - `token`: The token of your Telegram bot.

   For example:

   ```

   [telegram]

   type = telegram

   token = YOUR_BOT_TOKEN

   telegram_chat_id = YOUR_CHAT_ID

   ```

7. Use the `rclone` command-line tool to copy files to and from the Telegram backend. For example, to copy a file named `example.txt` to the Telegram backend, run the following command:

   ```

   rclone copy example.txt telegram:

   ```

   To copy a file from the Telegram backend to your local filesystem, run the following command:

   ```

   rclone copy telegram:/example.txt .

   ```

That should be all you need to make the `TelegramBackend` functional as an rclone backend.
